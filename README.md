## Overview
This app creates a server repository for API Data.

## Getting Started
To create this app, open an empty repository in Github, do an NPM init. The main folders we will be creating and using are the server.js, and connecting to a weather and movie API.

I thought this would take significantly longer than it did. Expectation was that it would take 2 hours and it took less than 1.
